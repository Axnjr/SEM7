# 1. Essential elements of a game in game theory. 
In game theory, the essential elements of a game are: 
1. Players: Decision-makers in the game. 
2. Strategies: The complete plan of action a player can take. 
3. Payoffs: Rewards or outcomes received based on chosen strategies. 
4. Information: What players know at various stages of the game. 
5. Actions: Specific choices available to players. 
6. Outcomes: The results of the players' combined actions. 
7. Rules of the Game: The structure and framework governing the game. 
8. Equilibrium: A stable state where no player benefits from changing their strategy.

# 2. Non-Cooperative Game Theory
- Definition: 
Focuses on how rational players make decisions independently, often in competitive settings where binding agreements are not possible.
- Key Features:
    - Individual Strategies: 
    Each player chooses their strategy to maximize their own payoff, considering the strategies of others.
    - Nash Equilibrium: 
    A common solution concept where no player can benefit by changing their strategy unilaterally.
- Examples: 
Prisoner’s Dilemma, Cournot Competition.
Applications: Used in economics, political science, and evolutionary biology to model competitive behaviors and conflicts.

# 3. Cooperative Game Theory
- Definition: 
Focuses on how players can form coalitions and make binding agreements to achieve a common goal, often in collaborative settings.
- Key Features:
    - Coalitions: 
    Players form groups (coalitions) to improve their collective outcomes.
- Examples: 
Bargaining games, coalition formation in politics.
Applications: Used in economics, business, and social sciences to model collaborative behaviors and negotiations

# 5. The Prisoner’s Dilemma: 
is a fundamental problem in game theory that demonstrates why two rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it seems that cooperation would be 
in their best interest. 

> Scenario 

Imagine two criminals, Alice and Bob, who are arrested and interrogated separately. The 
police lack sufficient evidence to convict either of a major crime, but they can convict them 
of a lesser offense. The criminals are offered a deal: 
1. If Alice betrays Bob (defects) and Bob remains silent (cooperates), Alice goes free, and Bob gets 10 years in prison. 
2. If Bob betrays Alice and Alice remains silent, Bob goes free, and Alice gets 10 years. 
3. If both betray each other, they both get 5 years in prison. 
4. If both remain silent, they each get 1 year for the lesser offense.
