# `UNIT - 2`

# 1. Strategic games: 
are a central concept in Game Theory, where multiple players make decisions simultaneously, taking into account the potential choices of others. The outcomes depend on the strategies of all players, highlighting the interplay between competition and cooperation.


# 2. The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma: 
is a fundamental problem in game theory that demonstrates why two rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it seems that cooperation would be 
in their best interest. 

## Scenario 

Imagine two criminals, Alice and Bob, who are arrested and interrogated separately. The 
police lack sufficient evidence to convict either of a major crime, but they can convict them 
of a lesser offense. The criminals are offered a deal: 
1. If Alice betrays Bob (defects) and Bob remains silent (cooperates), Alice goes free, and Bob gets 10 years in prison. 
2. If Bob betrays Alice and Alice remains silent, Bob goes free, and Alice gets 10 years. 
3. If both betray each other, they both get 5 years in prison. 
4. If both remain silent, they each get 1 year for the lesser offense. 


# 2. The Matching Pennies game: 
is a classic example in game theory that illustrates conflict, mixed strategies, and the concept of a zero-sum game. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Setup of the Game

- Players: Two players (let's call them Player A and Player B).
- Strategies:
Each player chooses one of two actions: Heads (H) or Tails (T).
- Payoffs:
    - If the two pennies match (both are Heads or both are Tails), Player A wins and takes $1 from Player B.
    - If the pennies do not match (one is Heads, the other is Tails), Player B wins and takes $1 from Player A.
- Payoff Matrix
The payoffs for Player A (Player B's payoffs are the negatives of these, as it's a zero-sum game) are as follows:

                                Player B: Heads (H)      |     Player B: Tails (T)
        Player A: Heads (H)	         +1 (A wins)	     |          -1 (B wins)
        Player A: Tails (T)	         -1 (B wins)	     |          +1 (A wins)
